## 📐 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
```yaml
Core:
  - HTML5 + CSS3 (Vanilla, no framework)
  - ES6 JavaScript

3D Animation:
  - Three.js r128 (Particle system)

Libraries:
  - Chart.js 4.4.0 (Reserved for future data viz)
  - GSAP 3.12.2 (Reserved for advanced animations)

APIs:
  - Intersection Observer (Native browser API)
  - requestAnimationFrame (Smooth animations)

Fonts:
  - Google Fonts: Inter (English)
  - System fonts: PingFang SC (Chinese)

CDN:
  - cdnjs.cloudflare.com
  - cdn.jsdelivr.net
```

### File Changes
```
docs/index.md → docs/index-static.md   # Backup original
docs/home.html → docs/index.html       # New dynamic homepage
mkdocs.yml                             # Updated navigation
```

### Performance Optimizations
- ✅ CDN-loaded libraries (browser caching)
- ✅ Lazy-loaded content (DOM generation on demand)
- ✅ Intersection Observer (animate only when visible)
- ✅ Debounced scroll handlers
- ✅ Optimized particle count (1,000 particles balanced for performance)

- **Shadows**: Layered depth (0-4-20px → 0-12-40px on hover)

### Animations
- **Fade-in-up**: Hero content staggered entrance
- **Counter animation**: Smooth number rolling
- **Card hover**: 8px lift + shadow enhancement
- **Progress bars**: 1s width transition
- **Particle rotation**: Continuous 3D movement

### Interaction Design
